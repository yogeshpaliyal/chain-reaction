## üéÆ Game Overview

Reaction Cascade is a turn-based strategy game played on a customizable grid. Players take turns placing "molecules" into cells. When a cell reaches its capacity, it explodes, distributing its molecules to adjacent cells and converting any opponent's molecules to the current player's color. The last player remaining on the board wins.

### Rules

- **Turn-based**: Players take turns placing one molecule per turn
- **Cell Capacity**:
  - Corner cells: 1 molecule
  - Edge cells: 2 molecules
  - Inner cells: 3 molecules
- **Explosions**: When a cell reaches its capacity, it explodes, sending one molecule to each adjacent cell
- **Chain Reactions**: Explosions can trigger other explosions, creating chain reactions across the board
- **Molecule Conversion**: When an explosion reaches a cell with opponent molecules, they convert to the attacker's color
- **Winning**: The last player with molecules on the board wins

## ‚ú® Features

- **Customizable Players**: 2-8 players with custom names and colors
- **Adjustable Grid Size**: Customize the dimensions of your playing field
- **Stunning Visuals**: Choose between 3D molecules with effects or simpler 2D graphics
- **Dark Mode Support**: Play comfortably day or night with theme options
- **Responsive Design**: Plays well on any device or screen size
- **Cross-Platform**: Built with Compose Multiplatform for Android, iOS, Desktop, and Web
